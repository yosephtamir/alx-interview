# Lockboxes: a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened.

# Concepts:

## Lists and List Manipulation:

Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.

## Graph Theory Basics:

Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.

## Algorithmic Complexity:

Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.

# Recursion:

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

# Queue and Stack:

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.

# Set Operations:

Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
